and Vertical&nbsp;Farming</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
philosophic case against controlled environment agriculture, with Deleuze
and&nbsp;Guattari</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Oddly
enough, I haven’t written about vertical farming on this platform yet. I’ve
often talked about how vertical farming is the next big coming step for
humanity, most simply because I can’t imagine how it won’t change society if it
comes to fruition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Vertical
Farming is growing crops indoors on many shelves in especially controlled or
curated environments. The crops are lit by LEDs or grow lights and hydroponics
supply water and nutrients. Compacting the crops in a controlled environment
allows more crops to be grown more efficiently, so it’s not uncommon to hear of
20 or 30 times the productivity of a traditional farm. Farming in this way
reduces food miles, meaning fresher produce at the grocery store or in your
favorite restaurant, and mitigates urban deserts. Vertical farming also uses
90% less the water a traditional farm uses. Plus, they look pretty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
biggest drawback is, from a technical point of view, that while vertical
farming was intended as a sustainable solution to feeding our populace it turns
out that it is incredible energy intensive. The LED light use alone, in one
story of a vertical farms, is equivalent to a ten story building. Which makes
sense, because if you have ten shelves and and LED panel per shelf you’ve
effectively just flattened a ten story building but you haven’t reduced its
energy consumption at all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>This isn’t
a good excuse to me to not pursue vertical farming — the technology will
improve, but it can only improve if people try craft better and better
versions. And the unit economics will work out at some point. It might be
expensive to harvest lettuce today, but who knows what ill change 20 or 30
years down the line?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But there
are good reasons to be careful…</span></p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span

<hr size=0 width="100%" align=center>

</span></div>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I have to
preface this with a disclaimer: I also don’t think civilization is ALL bad (I
am, after all, writing this on a laptop and you are reading this on social
media, so there were some benefits). But it should be at least addressed. This
is relevant because agriculture is the beating heart of civilization.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
thought goes that the first agriculturalists happened out of necessity because
agriculture, compared to hunting/gathering at that particular era, was time
intensive and exhausting. But agriculture lead to a surplus of food which
allowed small scale conflicts to become wars of attrition, to which an
agriculturalist would win out because of the excess resources. This forced
other non-agricultural societies to adopt agriculture. Farming and husbandry is
relatively complex and thus required stricter forms of organization which
eventually evolved to government and civilization.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In
addition to sustaining longer conflicts, other critiques of agriculture include
decreasing biodiversity by farming only monocultures, the associated increased
impacts of diseases (Swine flu, Mad Cow, etc), and the sheer energy intensity
of the act. Of course, there is also pollutants from fertilizers, water runoff,
and supply chain issues. See Joseph Tainter, Christopher Ryan’s <i>Sex at Dawn</i>,
and other associated anthropologists. Anarcho-primitivists love pointing out
how most evils of the modern era are due to civilization and how civilization
is mostly enabled by agriculture.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Again, I
just ate an orange that was probably shipped from California, in Michigan, in
September. There is a lot of hypocrisy in even making this claim, I am well
aware.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Generally
vertical farming is introduced as a solution to world hunger, but I think
that’s the wrong way to think about it. We produce enough food, in fact, we can
feed the world four times over but our supply chains are incredibly wasteful.
Vertical farming is an interesting supply chain solution because the quick turn
around and proximity allows a tighter push-pull supply chain model as opposed
to a pure push model, which is what we have right now. Or, I suppose, subsidies
providing a pull with a delayed push. And as mentioned earlier, vertical
farming also provides a good solution to the water conservation issue,
especially in distressed areas like Southwestern US or Central Africa, so maybe
VF is a more surgical application.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But
vertical farming currently does nothing for energy intensity nor does it
address the key issue endemic to agriculture as an institution itself: growth.
Agriculturalists wanted to grow their areas of control and need the surpluses
supplied by agriculture. And this impulse carried over in colonialist projects.
Just look at the Bengal Famine of 1770, how most of foodstuffs were taxed out
of Bengal territory by the British Empire. Or consider how the scientists who
came up with Haber-Bosch process, which allowed nitrogen recycling so that
agriculture could scale to feed the modern world, also provided not only the
means to make explosives but Zyklon B, the gas used in Nazi concentration
camps.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Vertical
farming, as an enterprise, would only exasperate these impulses. Conceivably,
vertical farming would be well suited to urban life and increase the
rural-urban divide as well as remove all dependency of urbanites from rural
folk. And what of jobs? Would low-skill labor farm hands be totally out of work
and be replaced by high skill programmers and control technicians in hyper
productive vertical farms? And here’s the thing, these questions I’m asking are
even about the most dangerous part of the agricultural revolution.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But what
would make vertical farming more dangerous than the first agricultural
revolution?</span></p>

<hr size=0 width="100%" align=center>

</span></div>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>There is a
concept that stretches over anthropology, sociology, postmodern philosophy and
media studies called “Deterritorialization” and “Reterritorialization.” In
anthropology, deterritorialization refers to a culture severed from a
geographic place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In the
past, this was a physical result often of colonization. For example, when the
British (again) ruled over Egypt, Victorian furniture was being sold in
Egyptian markets in as little as two years and remains there to this day. This
is not anything particularly novel or exciting. After all, cultures shift, mix,
and change through out history. But in recent years, it has become especially
incoherent because of advances in technology. I can now ingest the cultural
values of Japan from my home in Boston or San Fransisco via streamed anime.
Deterritorialization gained new prominence in a globalized society.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But what
does this have to do with vertical farming?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Think of
ecology as separate from geography. In general, we tend to blend the two, but
in reality an ecology is imposed onto a geography. In fact, Wes Jackson of the
acclaimed Land Institute, has said that (emphasis my own):</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Let’s
start at the atoms. And atoms are embedded within molecules, consist of them.
And then there are cells. And then there are tissues. And then there are
organs. And then there are organisms. And a man by the name of Feibelman wrote
a </span><a
href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/685952?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents"
target="_blank"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>paper</span></a><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> in the early 50s on the laws of
integrative levels. And he came to organisms, and biologists were saying, “What
comes next?” And some said species. Some said populations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But an
ecologist in Canada, J. “Stan” Rowe, said, “Well, what do the others have in
common?”<b> He said they have contiguous volume.</b> Species don’t have
contiguous volume. Populations don’t have contiguous volume. Ecosystems do.
Once ecosystems was there, those twelve laws of Feibelman fit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So
here’s the hierarchy: atoms, molecules, cells, tissues, organs, organisms,
ecosystems, and ecosphere.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'><img

of the Land Institute</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>What this
implies is that an ecology is its own organism, or super-organism more
accurately. This super-organism, the ecology, lives on a geography. What
vertical farming does is actual pretty insidious <i>because vertical farming
deterritorializes an entire ecology. </i>Given the trauma associated with
deterritorializing culture from geography, imagine the trauma of separating
ecology from geography.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>We haven’t
talked much about how deterritorialization works with immigration, although I’m
sure you could see the direct connection and understand its importance in a
post-2016 world. What vertical farming does is ask how we should address entire
ecologies immigrating. We haven’t even figured out how to handle populations of
people immigrating! And those two issues are actually one and the same in
several cases. Immigrant labor is often needed/exploited in order for
agriculture to sustain itself. With vertical farming, we may claim that it
“provides jobs,” but if the majority of labor is imported because it’s too
“high-skilled” the same ongoing discussion of H1-Bs in the tech industry just
gains steam.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I still
don’t think I’ve provided anything that would stop someone from pursuing
vertical farming, but I hope I’ve provided enough to give pause.</span></p>
