Dialethetics, and&nbsp;Bizarro</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Lex Luthor
and Superman are fighting, once again. Deep underground, under LexCorp tower,
Lex Luthor unveils his newest plot. He explains between blows that the folly of
Superman is that he presents too pristine an image to humanity, that as an
alien he has no right to confer his morality on the citizens of Metropolis.
Superman upholds a strict moral code, but the average man cannot uphold such a
code but is compelled to do so because of the presence of Superman. So Luthor
has made a laser beam, to make man better than his own humanity, like Superman
mockingly is, and democratize Superman’s powers. Luthor plans to beam the whole
city with this laser and Superman vows to stop him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Luthor
gains the upper hand and uses this opportunity to question Superman’s motives.
He chides Superman for not allowing others to take risks in bettering
themselves and accepting the consequences of their own actions. He tries to
convince Superman the payoff of a machine that makes humanity better is worth
the risk and blindly fighting technological progress leading to the betterment
of humanity goes against everything Superman says he stands for.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And in a
moment, Superman agrees. He tells Luthor, let me be the test then. Turn the
laser on me, and if there is a better version of me, he will agree to Luthor’s
plan. And if not, the answer is self-evident.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Luthor
grumbles “Ever the martyr” and turns the laser on Superman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>There
is a lot of contention as to what dialectics actually is, but for the purposes
of this excursion, I will use dialectics as referring to a form of argument
that follow thesis-antithesis-synthesis. Some say this is attributed to the
philosopher Hegel, others say it is misattributed to him. Still others claim
what I am about to present is not actually dialectics. Make of it what you
will.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
idea is that we begin with an argument, which we will call a thesis. What will
inevitably form is an attempt to discredit this argument and contradict it in
some turn, which we will call the antithesis. What must arise is a
reconciliation of the thesis and the antithesis and the marriage of these
arguments or the compromise of thesis arguments is called the synthesis.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Supposedly,
Karl Marx applied this dialectics to the material world and in particular to
history and whole systems. I’m not partial to this way of thinking at all, but
it’s a useful starting point if we want to discuss a new ideology for a new
age.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Bizarro
splits out from Superman and immediately attacks him. Bizarro and Superman
fight while Luthor looks at his laser wondering what went wrong. But something
strange happens.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Midway
through fighting, Bizarro lets out an unearthly scream. He convulses and
pulses, face twisting in horror. Suddenly, his insides flip inside out. His
heart beats outside him, lungs exposed, eyes lidless and wide. A muffled,
horrified scream echoes and then, using his super speed, Bizarro escapes the
basement in an adrenaline-fueled escape.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Superman
tries to stop him, but realizes that Bizarro is already gone. Before Luthor can
make a move, Superman grabs the laser and flies out of the wreckage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Sometime
later, Superman is seen conversing with Professor Emil Hamilton in between
shots of the news, showing great social unrest. Wealth inequality and
apprehension about the rapid pace of automation, driven in part by LexCorp,
dominate the airwaves. The big fear is how to usher in Total Automation and
what the role of humanity will be in this new era. And where will the energy
come for this brave new world? Superman knows super-strength has no place in
this sort of discussion. He can’t arrest anyone for having an opinion. He asks
Hamilton to turn off the news so he can concentrate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Hamilton
complies and explains the laser again. He tells Superman that the laser created
a version of Superman to negate his evil attributes, but instead negates all of
his attributes. But he says this itself is a problem, because there are
infinite ways to negate something. Even a direct negation is related to the
original. If there is one way to be right, there are a thousand ways to be
wrong.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>That’s why
Bizarro turned inside-out. If Superman’s insides are inside, then Bizarro’s
must be outside. But, Hamilton goes on, it gets worse. Because it appears
Bizarro will continue to cycle through ways to oppose Superman’s existence
until he becomes composed of antimatter. And if only a gram is as powerful as a
nuclear bomb, Superman’s weight of antimatter might decimate life on earth as
we know it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Hamilton
tells Superman, the faster you find Bizarro, the better. Bizarro is a ticking
time-bomb.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>If
dialectics is the antiquated way to view history, an antiquated tool for
analysis, what would be a newer way? The new kid on the block might be
Dialethetics. This is a much more complex and difficult method of discourse, so
bear with me. Consider the following statements:</span></i></p>

<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
     following sentence (2) is true.</span></i></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The previous
     sentence (1) is false.</span></i></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>If you
attempt to follow the logic of the above statements, you will see that you will
loop in between the two statements forever. This is actually somewhat what
happens in some computer bugs. The computer finds itself switching between two
statements in a constant loop. A more concise way to show this paradox might
be:</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“I am
always lying” said the liar.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Was the
liar lying when he said he was lying? If he was, then he told the truth. So he
can’t always be lying, right? But then he’s not a liar…</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>These
mind-bending statements rely on what we call self-reference. They seem to fall
apart because they refer to themselves. The study of statements that are
simultaneously true and false is referred to as dialethetics. Here, thesis and
antithesis are one and the same, both at the same time.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Superman
is out in search of Bizarro. He flies over protests against automation and sees
overdose, crumbling infrastructure, and abandoned factories. No hope anywhere
it seems. He talks on the streets as Clark Kent, talking with waitresses,
nurses, rideshare-drivers some of who point him in the direction of Bizarro but
always with differing descriptions. Sometimes he’s black. Sometimes he’s a she.
Sometimes he speaks English in a butchered grammar and says the opposite of
what he means. Sometimes he speaks cogently, but backmasked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And none
of them seem to care. Not the teachers, not the factory workers. No-one.
Because they all have children, and mortgages, and car payments. No time to
worry about Superman’s latest supervillain. Clark attempts to explain the
gravity of the situation, but the people don’t care. Their world is already
ending. The world is nearing Total Automation. The only question left is who
will power it, and what control will they exert?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Superman
finally finds Bizarro in Antarctic (because of course, the Fortress of Solitude
is in the arctic). The “Free-Range of Community” glows an insidious orange.
Superman makes his way through, carefully, ready to do battle with a
potentially nuclear Bizarro. Armed with Luthor’s Laser, he opens the door to
reveal…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>There
isn’t really an easy introduction to dialethetics that I know about. I first
was exposed via Godel’s incompleteness theorem in my calculus class. The book </span></i><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal
Golden Braid<i> discusses how self-reference is core of self-awareness and uses
paradoxes like the ones I discussed to illustrate the point. Hofstadter (author
of the Eternal Golden Braid book) goes further though by showing how
intelligence and self-awareness are connected and how intelligence might emerge
in a complex system, be it an ant colony or a neural network. What if we
applied the principles of dialethetics to history or to a vast system like
capitalism or socialism?</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Marx
applied the thesis-antithesis-synthesis model to show that
captialism-socialism-communism might emerge from history. The crisis from the
incompatible systems of socialism and capitalism would result in communism and
the makings for a crisis were evident in his time with rapid industrialization
and deep, quick changes to society.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
makings of a crisis are evident in our time too, I believe, but as I mentioned
I hold little faith in dialectics. But dialethetics might offer a similar
insight to a new “-ism” that dialectics offered to leftist thought in the
advent of socialism.</span></i></p>

Kent. Not a Bizarro-Clark Kent, but the same Clark Kent Superman professes to
the world. Superman asks what’s going on. Clark explains that Superman was his
own opposite the entire time. That while Superman is near god to most humans,
Clark Kent is the most forgettable every-day human imaginable. A man who grew
up in humble beginnings, who pines for the girl at work, who loves his parents.
The story of hundreds of thousands of people across the world. While Superman
can imperviously alter any situation to his will, Clark Kent must simply
observe and occasionally express sympathy for the problems he sees his fellow
man endure. Man is noble, but ultimately individually powerless.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Clark
(Bizarro) tells Superman that true negation is to unleash his power unto the
world, let everyone use the growing antimatter he feels himself convulsing
towards. He chides Superman, telling him that Superman does not believe enough
in humanity to let them make their own choices. Superman is reminded of his
conversation with Luthor and relents. Clark (Bizarro), steps into a hob-cobbled
contraption that he claims will reroute the energy of the antimatter explosion
to most major power grids. But if it fails, Superman will have to contain the
explosion with Luthor’s Laser and send Bizarro back to non-existence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It seems
to begin fine, but as the reaction grows in intensity it becomes evident that
the contraption will not hold. Clark Kent morphs once more to Bizarro, who
compels Superman to “not shoot me.” Superman aims and fires. As the laser
consumes and evaporates the contraption, Bizarro waves and says “Hello old
world, goodbye new world.”</span></p>

distance grows and slowly comes into view. Is it a bird? Is it a plane? It’s
not Superman. It’s not even Clark Kent. It’s Kal-El. He lands to the cheers of
hundreds of people, and waves graciously to everyone. They all seem happy,
well-fed and content.</span></p>
