<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:13.5pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I
Feel Old — Some wayward thoughts on time from a homeward bound twenty-something</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I recently
made a trip up to Pittsburgh. Well, down, I suppose, Detroit is kind of
northwest of Pittsburgh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I’ve
traveled to Pittsburgh many times actually. For those who’ve fallen out of
touch, I went to college there and it was swell. Went back a few times, mostly
to see friends. But every time I made the trip back home, I felt a peculiar
feeling. One I couldn’t name. Not until now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I felt
old.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And I
shouldn’t. No twenty-something should. But more and more, that seems to be the
norm. Even around the campus I visiting, I saw it. Weary looks. Halfhearted
waves. How have you been? Busy. You? Busy. This isn’t a nursing home, it’s a
college campus. What gives? Why does everyone sound like the baby-boomers at
work?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Anyways,
I’m driving out. I’m at the wheel and this time I have company. A friend who
lives relatively close. We shoot the breeze for a bit, but eventually he takes
his passenger’s privilege to fall asleep. Ah well. Alone again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Not that I
mind. I like just driving and letting my thoughts wander. This time I’m
admiring the Appalachian mountain range and thinking that familiar animist
thought — what would these mountains say if they were alive?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I imagine
they would feel equally as old. Mountain top mining. Opioid crisis. Appalachia.
I remember reading in elementary school that the Appalachian Mountains were
more rounded than the Rockies because they were older and had been worn down
more. An apt metaphor for all of us in 2017, I felt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>If you’ve
been living under a rock (or reading this from a future not akin to the stone
age), the news cycle in 2017 was particularly traumatic. A lot of attention was
shifted to the Midwest in the wake of a contested 2016 election. Or maybe more
accurately, a 2016 upset. And there is no way not to notice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I’m
mulling over this thought as we pass the Ohio Turnpike. The Ohio Turnpike is my
favorite because it’s smooth sailing and there are plenty of clean rest stops.
The toll slams hard, but at least this time I wasn’t paying for that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I take the
ticket. My friend puts it in the dashboard (he’s awake for now, but he’ll sleep
again shortly).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And it
goes on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>This time
the feeling isn’t sinking in as hard and I’m trying to figure out why. Usually
I feel very oppressed by leaving but this time it’s just the slightest tinge of
nostalgia. It’s not a sledgehammer. What is that feeling? What’s the right
word?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>A friend
of mine pointed me to the </span><a
href="http://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/" target="_blank"><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows</span></a><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>, an attempt to make words to
describe phenomenon or experiences that aren’t already named. Tumblr, is my
cynical response. But I do like some of the words the author of the blog has
come up with. Most relevant?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Zenosyne.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The sense
that time is accelerating.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I think
that explains why so many people of my generation feel and act so aged. Our
sense of time is, collectively, accelerating in an exponential fashion. If you
looked at the world over some two-month period in 1980 versus some two-month
period in 2016 you would see what I mean.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
complexity of events and the meta-analysis and propagation in 2016 far outpaces
that in 1980. But we have finite minds with limited bandwidth. Our processing
hasn’t evolved to keep pace. But we still try, right? I mean sure, some of us
tapped out, but a substantial portion are still trying to make sense of
everything, yeah?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So we look
back at last month and compare that to the month before and because time is
accelerating at an exponential speed it feels like that last month was twice as
long as the month before. And we feel as though we’ve aged twice as much. Or at
least, I do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>That’s
probably why Buzzfeed uses nostalgia so effectively. Why so many wanted a
return to simpler times in our most recent election. Not that this is a new
point, it’s well worn, but what I don’t think is discussed is how goddamn old
it makes us all feel, age be damned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And it
goes on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>We pass by
acres of cornfields. Ohio is pretty much just cornfield. Some stereotypes are
true I suppose. It’s one of the things I dislike most about the Midwest. Ohio
is very flat. Michigan too. I feel exposed. Only the highway stretches before
me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>That’s the
other aspect of time though, space, right? Like Einstein and General relativity
and all that. It takes time to cross space. Crossing space will take time. That
whole expanse of cornfield is just time to kill. Waiting to be taken advantage
of, to slow down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Another
stereotype, on I think is less true, is that Midwesterners are slower than the
coastal counterparts. Stereotypes are like clichés in that they are only
adopted as pragmatic means to deal with life. There is no pragmatic reason to
take it slow. Or so I thought. Maybe that’s the antidote to zenosyne.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>If that’s
true, I resign myself to the cliché “It’s better to travel than to arrive”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>If the
general relativity view of time had any bearing on psychological time, it would
mean time should decelerate, right? Well, no, we can now cover distances far
quicker now than we have in the past. That’s probably what contributes to the
explosion in complexity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Looking
out at the cornfields I can’t help but think of the Catcher in the Rye. I
remember when I was younger my father told me he originally thought of the
whole catcher-in-the-rye metaphor was about the mind trying to randomly catch
thoughts. That the catcher is the mind and the children running through the
field and coming dangerously close to the edge of a cliff are thoughts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>If you
haven’t read the book, it’s actually about Holden Caulfield trying to maintain
some sense of innocence and the catcher in the rye is him trying to protect
innocent children from adulthood. If you can’t maintain your innocence, the
next best thing is to prevent the loss of innocence in others.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Both speak
to our times, but I like my dad’s interpretation better. I think it means more
in our day and age.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And it
goes on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>My friend
next to me wakes up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Ugh. How
long was I out?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“About an
hour. Not long. Want to stop somewhere, grab a bite?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“How long
have we been on the road?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“About two
hours, little over that. We’re about halfway.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>We
stopped. Ate. Did our business. Drove onward without incident. It goes on. It
always goes on. We barrel headfirst into an uncertain future of increasing
complexity, our past slipping out of reach faster and faster. We are becoming
more akin to animal than man, in a state of constant present. A folk society
mindset. Tribal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In the
end, we end up becoming ourselves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I wonder
what would happen in an alternate reality, where complexity decreases, more
like an inverse logarithmic function. The past becomes more and more
inscrutable, increasingly out of our comprehension but the future seems
simpler, deterministic. Predictable even. Would we similarly fear an inevitable
breakdown?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>All in
all, an uneventful trip through some of the Midwest. Like I said, I’ve been in
a lot of places in the Midwest. Cleveland, Chicago, Indianapolis. Smaller towns
too, like Yale, MI and Akron, OH. I made it home okay (obviously, as I’m
writing this). I guess my biggest takeaway is that I wish more Americans took
the time to drive through flyover country.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Also,
feelings are stupid. Don’t have them if you can avoid it.</span></p>
