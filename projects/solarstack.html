    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>
        The core idea was to create a "3D solar panel" to capture more light at a given time and thus generate more power.
    </p>

    <h3>The problem statement</h3>

    <p>
        Solar panels as they currently exist capture light along a 2D plane and are limited by a property called "insolation."
        Insolation is the power in an area that is given off by the sun (or more generally, any light source). This is a fixed property. 
        The insolation of the sun is 1040 W/m^2. This means that even with a 100% efficient solar panel, one could not ever generate more than 1040 W/m^2.
    </p>

    <p>
        Light doesn't travel in two dimensions, though, it travels through space in three dimensions. 
        What if we could take advantage of this? Hypothetically, we would be able to generate more energy with a smaller surface area. 
    </p>

    <h3>The proposed solution</h3>

    <p>
        The first issue with developing a "three-dimensional solar panel/solar cell" is that if you turn the panel parallel to a ray of light, the panel can not absorb any of the light. 
        Thus, we need a method of redirecting the light to be perpendicular to the panel. 
        In devices like iPads, Kindles and some laptops, there is a a portion of the device called a backlight. 
        When you start your device up, it often gives a white screen. This is the backlight. 
        This backlight is composed of a light guide and several LEDs.
        The LEDs are actually only at the edges of the light guide. 
        The light guide redirects the light perpendicular, out the face of the light guide, which is what illuminates the white start screen of a Kindle or iPad.
        What if we used this for sunlight?

    <p>
        While some sunlight does get through the light guide, it would be better if we could concentrate sunlight to hit the edge more directly. 
        We used what is known as a "linear cylindrical lens." 
        Much like a magnifying glass concentrates light to a point, linear cylindrical lenses concentrate light into a line.

    <p>
        Finally, we need an enclosure to hold all of these components together. 
        For the sake of experimentation, we wanted to compare one flat solar panel, generating power as is commonly seen, against a stack of panels.
        The surface area of the control solar panel should be the same as the surface area of linear lenses . This way, we can see which generates more power - the control panel or the solar stack.

    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    
    <p>
        While the device works, it wasn't as effective as initially hoped to be. We used a measure we 
        dubbed "energy density," or watts per meter squared. The solar box did not generate more energy than
        the control solar panel, but if you calculated how many watss per square meter the solar panel generated 
        and compared that against the watts per square meter the box generated, you can see the box had a higher 
        energy density.
