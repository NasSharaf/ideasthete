know the Amazon Rain Forest was man-made?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Shocking,
but true. At least according to </span><a
href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6328/925" target="_blank"><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>these researchers</span></a><span

actually engineered by the indigenous peoples of the area 8000 years ago. In
fact, the soil of the Amazon is what is called </span><a

target="_blank"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>terra preta</span></a><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>, the result of indigenous
slash-and-char forestry techniques and is still the subject of research. The
thought goes that the biochar (biocharcoal from slash-and-char methods) could
help sequester carbon dioxide and provide an insight into more sustainable
agriculture. This supersoil enabled the growth and selection of birch nuts,
rubber, and cocoa and probably allowed for the rise of a vast network of cities
and towns.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Something
like this I imagine</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Indigenous
peoples are often not given credit for their achievements. We tend to simplify
our view of Native American tribes to be in line with <i>Pocahontas.</i> Did
you know for example, that some researchers now believe that the plagues that
ravaged north American Indians might have </span><a
href="https://news.stanford.edu/news/2009/january7/manvleaf-010709.html"
target="_blank"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>given rise to
the mini Ice Age</span></a><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>
between 1500 and 1750? The thought is that the rolling plagues wiped out so
many Native peoples who generally deforested for their own gain that the
forests could grow without any control. The wildly growing forests sequestered
so much carbon that it actually dropped global temperatures. Now, I should
mention researchers also think this was a multifaceted phenomenon, but
reforestation is considered a “certainly a first-order contributor.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>What
fascinates me is the idea of viewing man’s control over its environment as a
civil engineering project. I think that “tribal” or “primitive” peoples weren’t
necessarily more environmentally conscious or one-with-nature types but I do
think their view of society was shaped differently, what I would believe is a
deeper and more nuanced view of their society. I think they viewed their
environment, their ecologies specifically, as a form of infrastructure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>When we
tend to think of infrastructure or when pundits refer to it, they usually mean
the underlying basic structures that enable our society. Things like our
sewers, natural gas, roads, bridges, the electrical grid, and maybe even
(somewhat increasingly) the internet. These are public structures for
everybody’s use and often falls within the domain of government. Generally, the
public discussion is about how our infrastructure is falling apart. Most
obvious example is how the ASCE (American Society of Civil Engineers) has
graded American infrastructure at a D+.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But think
deeper. If infrastructure is the underlying structures that enable society, why
shouldn’t air quality be part of our infrastructure? Why shouldn’t soil quality
be part of our infrastructure? Global temperatures should equally be part of
our structure if society can’t maintain itself if it gets too hot or cold,
right? Clean water, pure air, strong biodiversity, and high soil quality are
not only fundamental to a well-functioning society, they have the added
benefits of higher public health, increased energy efficiency, and higher
property values.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>None of
this is actually novel by the way. Viewing the environment as infrastructure is
what is called </span><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_infrastructure" target="_blank"><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>green infrastructure</span></a><span

infrastructure (the blue is for water). And sometimes the study of systems of

called </span><a

saying is that they are fundamentally related.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>After all,
man-made infrastructure is mostly at the whims of ecological forces. The most
common causes of failure are often environmental — moisture rot, heavier than
usual snows, flood damage, etc. Civil engineers know this, that’s why there is
such a great emphasis on sustainable engineering within civil engineering but
not so much in computer engineering. And those cause of failure are increasing
because we aren’t maintaining our ecological infrastructure. Sure, Houston was
flooding, but that infrastructure was never meant to see that sort of </span><a

with.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It is
often a right-wing political talking point that American infrastructure (I’m
American, in case any readers are from outside of the states) is crumbling. We
face overcrowded, collapsing roads, bridges and airports. We also tend to talk
about the growing insecurity of our electrical grids, aging IT centers, and
most worryingly, our nuclear arsenal. It is also estimated that the losses in
productivity and in American GDP over the next ten or so years will be roughly
4 trillion dollars.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But
realize that these are literally the same arguments left-wing pundits make when
talking about climate change. Our climate infrastructure is crumbling as
pollution is worse, biodiversity is being crowded out by monocultures, and
ecosystems are collapsing. We also talk about the need for resilience,
security, of our cities and towns. The looming existential threat of a
collapsing environment is just as pressing as economic or nuclear threats. And
check it out — some social scientists decided it was worthwhile to calculate
the worth of the entire environment and found that it was worth </span><a

a pretty penny.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It’s clear
that addressing climate change in a doom-and-gloom way is not enough. It’s
generally too depressing and doesn’t offer an actual solution, just another
reason to mope about the end of the world. One proposed way to enable action is
by essentially gamifying or bringing social competition in to the mix. </span><a

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I think a
variation of the same phenomenon happened but in reverse. Politically we
assigned teams and decided to compete, but instead of playing the same game we
decided to play on two separate fields. Now, right leaning members decry
political climate action as government overreach, even saying environmental
mandates prevent fixing failing infrastructure, but deny the problem of climate
change at all. Left leaning members acknowledge the problem of climate change
but do a poor job of showing how green-collar work increases jobs at home,
offers opportunity for entrepreneurship and wealth, and can engage
working-class Americans. Both are discussing the same issue, but from radically
different points of view. The fundamental problem, I think, is a question of
values.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The TED
talk above discusses how speaking to each others values can be more persuasive
that belligerently shouting talking points at each other. Robb Willer discusses
how an essay that frames environmentalism in terms of purity and beauty was
more effective in changing conservative minds on climate change, even though
the essay had nothing to do climate change specifically. Speaking to the
audience’s value is public communication 101. Now, I’m definitely not the guy
to do this. For one thing, I cited a TED talk, which I might’ve well have done
in between liberal latte sips and bites of elitist avocado toast. But framing
the discussion of climate change in terms of infrastructure might be a starting
point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Evolution
and natural selection dictate that the species that fit their environment most
closely survive. This is also true for technology. And infrastructure. If the
environment is changing — man-made or not, drastic or not — and it is changing
outside of the adaptability or resilience of our infrastructure, our roads and
bridges will collapse. That’s really my point about that Amazon
rainforest — that curating the forest was mutually beneficial for the tribes as
much as it was for the growth of the rainforest and those two things were never
unconnected. Addressing climate change and addressing our failing
infrastructure are also not unconnected.</span></p>
