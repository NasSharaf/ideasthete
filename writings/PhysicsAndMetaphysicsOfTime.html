<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Why so
many paradoxes regarding time?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It’s a
curious thing. Every time travel sci-fi story I can think of almost always ends
up with some sort of paradox or plot hole.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Consider
the popular <i>Back to the Future</i> series. Marty McFly travels back in time
with Doc Brown and accidentally prevents the situation that caused his parents
to meet. This creates a paradox in which the most probable timeline is one in
which he is never born. But if he were never born, there would’ve been no Marty
McFly to go into the past to prevent his parents from meeting. Which would mean
that his parents actually <i>would</i> meet and go on to have Marty. So which
is it, does Marty prevent his parents from meeting or not? This is called the
Grandfather paradox, stipulated of the age old question “What if I went back in
time and killed my grandparents?” Or more humorously, in <i>Futurama</i>, “What
if I was my own grandfather?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Another
common time-travel paradox is called the causal loop. Think of <i>the
Terminator</i> series. Humanity develops Skynet, an artificial intelligence
that plummets the world into nuclear holocaust. John Connor rallies the
survivors to lead a war against the machines. In retaliation, Skynet sends back
a terminator to kill Sarah Connor (and then in the sequel both Sarah and a
young John Connor). But in doing so, the remnants of the Terminator inspire
human scientists to begin developing Skynet. The actions of the future directly
cause the actions of the past which cause the actions of the future and so on.
And it’s kind of a relevant question because the causal loop paradox kind of
questions the multiverse theory. Is there a universe in our set of multiverses
that just circles back on itself or needs to circle back on itself in order to
even exist?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Even in
the physics world, the multiverse theory is kind of one version of the parallel
timelines idea that pervades pop culture. Basically, this view of time says
that all possibilities for events exist in separate universes. Like in the
movie the Butterfly Effect or Back to the Future 2. My favorite example, hands
down, is the episode Remedial Chaos Theory in TV show <i>Community</i>. In this
episode, the seven members of a study group roll a die to see who goes and gets
pizza. The roll of the die creates six separate timelines in which a different
person leaves for the pizza. All sorts of hi-jinks ensue, it’s a great episode,
you should go watch it right now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>There
really isn’t an explicit paradox in this, depending on how it’s done. If it is
like in <i>Community</i> or in the <i>Butterfly Effect</i> (surprisingly),
where each timeline is its own world than there isn’t an obvious paradox, at
least to me. If a parallel timeline is done like in <i>Back to the Future 2</i>
where a future self and a past self can occupy the same time, for example
future Biff talking to younger Biff, then there is a problem. If the universe
is a closed system, we must conserve mass, meaning the total mass of the
universe can’t increase or decrease. If a future version of you comes to visit
you, than the total mass of the universe has increased. This isn’t so much a
paradox as it is a violation of the laws of physics, but I think we can throw
it in the same pile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Why is it
that even theoretically it is so hard to find a self-consistent, logical
time-travel story that doesn’t induce a paradox? For example, a common
criticism of the <i>Harry Potter</i> series is why didn’t Dumbledore use the
time-turner to go back in time and prevent the rise of Voldemort in <i>Harry
Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i>? Some franchises try to get around some
of these paradoxes. Some sci-fi stories try to address the causal loop problem
by using something like astral projections or visions of the future, something
can’t influence a direct action on the past. But these franchises don’t
recognize that even a vision from the future can incite that future as
self-fulfilling prophecies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I think I
have an answer. It’s kind of convoluted, but I think it gets at why so many of
these paradoxes occur.</span></p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>

<hr size=0 width="100%" align=center>

</span></div>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Alright,
so in order to try to understand why these paradoxes occur I made my own. I
posted this guy on facebook, so let’s see how you fare with this:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Imagine a
time machine. The rules of this time machine are that you can only time travel
while the time machine is active and existing. So if the time machine was made
in 2018 you could not go to 2016.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now, the
physicist who crafted this time machine is smart, but vicious. He realizes that
if the universe is eternal, and human nature is what it is, that many people
will try to travel back to the first moment the time machine is active to claim
that they were the first to appear out of the time machine. Over an infinite
trajectory, this could mean billions of people pour out of the time machine as
soon as it is activated. To stop this, he places an automated turret, a gun,
pointed at the time machine as negative incentive for future generations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now the
physicist doesn’t want people to not use the time machine. After all he made it
to be used. He simply wants it to be manageable, so at some time he must remove
or disable the gun turret.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>When does
he disable the turret?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now I want
to clear up a few things before we move forward, because when I originally
posted this many (most) seemed to miss the point. I don’t care what the time
machine actually is — it can be a Delorean, it can be a train, it could be a
giant Hot Pocket. I don’t care, as long as you cannot travel to before the time
travel device was created. And this is because I was trying to close off one
paradox called the Time tourism paradox. Basically the time tourism paradox
asks if time travel is possible, where are all the time travelers? My solution
is that the mechanism that allows time travel will only allow time travel while
that mechanism exists. We don’t see time travelers because we haven’t invented
time travel yet!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The second
landmine I want to diffuse is that the turret doesn’t actually matter. I got a
lot of responses about how future people will have body armor or how you can’t
defend the space with just a turret. It doesn’t have to be a turret. He could
hard wire it to explosive or poison gas or a nuclear bomb. The important bit is
that it is a <b>negative incentive</b>. There just has to be some disincentive
to try to prevent future travelers from overwhelming the machine on startup.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So, with
all that out of the way, how does this explain why there are so many time
paradoxes?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The answer
is that time <i>is</i> information.</span></p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>

<hr size=0 width="100%" align=center>

</span></div>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>First,
keep this definition in your pocket: information is the physical orientation of
matter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Alright,
imagine a universe with only two point masses, point A and point B, with point
B revolving around point A. You have a view port into this universe but every
time you open this view port the two point masses do not seem to have moved.
Could you say that time had passed in this universe? No, you could not. The
information that you have observed, the two points positions, was the same. The
physical orientation of these points was the same. Because the information was
the same each observation you cannot claim time has passed. Maybe this is
because what we call “time” is actually just a given physical orientation of
matter. In our two-point universe, time seems to repeat. But in our large,
complex and chaotic universe time never repeats because there are infinitely
many positions any given particle could assume.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>You might
be asking “Ok, but what does that have to do with the turret paradox?” The
important bit is to recognize that the negative incentive I bolded is really
only information. The turret is never actually fired. The time machine is never
actually turned on. The only thing that happens is that the scientist <i>physically
orients</i> the world prior to turning on the time machine. This propagates
information to the future. The turret doesn’t even have to be loaded! The only
thing that needs to happen to prevent overwhelming the time machine with the
time traveling equivalent of “First!” commenters on Youtube is that future
peoples need to believe that there is a credible threat. Even if it doesn’t
exist. The issue is that as soon as this turret is revealed to be empty or
revealed to not be a credible threat, that information travels into the future
too. Which means that as soon as this physical orientation that prevented this
information overload from occurring is undone, that overload is basically
guaranteed to happen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>This is
why I stressed on the incentives. Incentives only work via information. I have
to know that I stand to gain something or lose something in order to make a
decision. The information comes first. The mere knowledge of some value is
inherently useful by itself. The knowledge of the existence of the time machine
is enough to cause people to try to storm one moment in time. The knowledge of
a disincentive might be able to prevent some people from storming the time
machine. This whole paradox actually speaks to relevant issues today, like how
to manage this massive influx of data and immigration policies (although we
deal with immigration across space and not time).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I have no
idea how to address this time travelers paradox, I just thought it was a good
way to introduce a thought I rarely see discussed directly in time-travel
sci-fi. What is the role of information across time?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Maybe you
can figure it out.</span></p>
