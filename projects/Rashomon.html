<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>About a
year ago today, as Facebook has so kindly reminded me, I had an idea for news
betting exchange. I’ve somewhat given up on the idea in the short-term, but I
wanted to lay out my thought process so that you might get something from it.
If nothing else, I hope that the way I think about these ideas gives you some
inkling as to how you might be able to think about other problems.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In <i>Freakonomics</i>,
Steven Dubner stresses that the fundamental idea to economics is incentive
based thinking and that economics is actually just the study of incentives.
What he means is actually pretty simple — think about what incentives are at
play, for every party involved, and you now think like an economist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Initially
I got interested in economics as a misguided attempt to ‘adult’ better and
figure out finances and stocks and things like that. But pretty soon, I started
to like this way of thinking, as for some reason it complemented the
engineering half of my brain. And whenever you discover a new tool, you tend to
try to use it everywhere, right? When all you have is a hammer, every problem
looks like a nail.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It being
2017 at the time, I applied this line of logic to the issue of “Fake News.”
First, what are the incentives for the news consumer? Most consumers would
probably say they keep up with the news to stay informed. But this is actually
not true. People keep up with the news because:</span></p>

<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Gather
     evidence to support their worldview. This leads to confirmation bias.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Impress
     people they admire or think are smart that they, the consumer, are smart.
     This leads to filter bubbles.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Signal
     to people they admire or think are smart that they, the consumer, share
     common ground. This leads to echo chambers.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>That’s one
end. The other end is the media companies. They would probably say that their
incentive is their civic duty to shine a light on the ills of society. But
really, their incentives are:</span></p>

<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Survival.
     Many papers are simply trying to adapt to a quick-changing landscape. Many
     media companies are looking for a sustainable business model in this
     information age because print doesn’t sell and competitors will often give
     content for free, setting a market price of $0.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Profit.
     This might mean subscriptions (but that means paywalls) or it could mean
     advertisements. Trying to get eyeballs on ads generally means that papers
     resort to ‘viral’ techniques and in general sub-par journalism.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Look
     like they have integrity. It might sound like I’m being cynical, but I
     don’t mean it in a bad way. The newspapers want to be relevant and trusted
     so that they can convert that into subscriptions, so they have to earn
     that trust in some way or at least look like they deserve that trust.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So what
does all of this mean?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Quite
simply, the reason fake news was so prevalent was because all of the incentives
were misaligned. The consumer end was incentivized to become more tribal,
polarize more, and seek out what confirms their worldview. Media organizations
are desperate enough to go along with this because that generates enough ad
revenue to get by. Neither side is incentivized to try to figure out the truth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>This seems
disheartening, but understanding a problem means that there is greater
understanding of how to solve that problem. If a system of misaligned
incentives or disincentives are collapsing our idea of truth, then a system of
properly aligned incentives should help us build an idea of collective truth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Another
mental model I was mulling over was Elon Musk’s First Principals thinking. The
idea in First Principles thinking is to start from the very fundamental
building blocks, the absolutely smallest minutia you know to be true and build
up a solution from there. We’ve kind of done that already with this incentives
based analysis. But the other thing Elon Musk has added to this is to ‘try to
imagine…I don’t want to say utopia, but…try to imagine a better future.’ Let’s
imagine what the ideal solution would be then.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Elon
explaining First Principles thinking</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Ideally,
if I could, I would simply pay everyone to read as much of the news as possible
equally. Everyone gets paid to read everything — Fox, CNN, Infowars, Huffington
Post, all of it. My thought here is that the only thing that would get people
over this disincentive to only chase the news they want would be if you paid
people to give an equal chance to the news they don’t like. But I’m not
remotely wealth enough to do that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But the
next best thing would be to offer the opportunity to get paid for reading
something you potentially disagree with. A bet. And in fact, betting on whether
you think the news is fake or not is a much better solution, because it forces
you to have what Nassim Nicholas Taleb calls “skin in the game.” You will be
much more hesitant to call something fake news unless you were sure it was fake
news.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Think to
children, who often when a friend is making exaggerated claims will say “I’ll
bet you didn’t” or “I’ll bet you did”. Generally, this is the child’s way of
testing social claims — dare the opposing party to perform and put a stake on
it. Pretty simple.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“His
argument for these is pretty simple: they [prediction markets] ensure that we
have a financial stake in being accurate when we make forecasts, rather than
just trying to look good to our peers.” — Nate Silver, the Signal and
the&nbsp;Noise</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But what
about the media organizations? How does news consumers betting on their content
help a news organization? Best way is in a betting exchange, the exchange earns
a commission on each bet. Betting exchanges help facilitate setting up the bet,
maintain fair odds (fairer than a bookie at least), and if ran with the intent
to supply news companies with a commission, could eliminate this clickbait,
ad-driven business model that’s destroying the idea of truth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Well,
supposing you buy this logic, the question now is how do we do this? Imagine if
one receives anonymized, randomized articles (without giveaways to the channel,
author, etc) and is forced at the end to determine whether it is Democratic or
Republican. Or sponsored content or genuine reporting. Or even whether the
article is from a joke news site or not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'><img

alt="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*RZfjuNIyWJoMGHD0.jpg"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But how do
you know if you are correct? Everyone will dispute the truth of an event or
thought piece. This is true, but it is much harder to dispute the political
leanings of a publication on a relative scale to other publications. I think
most will agree that the New Revolution is nowhere near as left as Antifa News.
It is about where the article falls on a relative scale compared to its peers,
so to speak. Sometimes I’ve heard this called the Overton window (its not what
it really is, but its still interesting.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>What we
are really trying to deal with is uncertainty. I’m not certain about the
quality of my news. Most Americans are uncertain about the quality of their
news. Bets are market-based solutions to deal with uncertainty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Think of
it like this, if I said, “I’ll bet you the sky is blue”, would you take that?
Probably not, because we know that the sky is blue. This generally leads people
to believe that placing a bet means that we are betting on an event and not a
state, like in prediction markets. Who <i>will </i>be the next president? What <i>will
</i>natural gas go for in two years? <i>Will </i>Britain leave the EU? These
are events that neither party know the outcome to with binary results.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>My point
is simple. We shouldn’t limit our bets to future events. Time is not what we
are betting on — we are betting on uncertainty. I won’t take the “Is the sky
blue?” bet because I am certain it is. I am not certain, however, whether the
media is accurately reporting or not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I have
called this idea the “<i>Rashomon</i> idea” because what we are effectively
dealing with in our Fake News crisis is competing ideas and views about how the
world works. In Akira Kurosawa’s <i>Rashomon</i>, the Japanese court must deal
with four competing accounts of a murder near the Rashomon city gate. The movie
deals with issues we are dealing with now. Namely, how can we reconcile
mutually contradictory accounts of the same events when it is in all men’s
self-interest to bend the narrative for himself?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>A news
betting market would hold people accountable and use the inherent self-interest
of people towards building some truth. Those who are accurate and perceptive
get rewarded and can be looked to as guides in this uncertain landscape. Those
who are wrong? Well…</span></p>
