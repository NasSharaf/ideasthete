instinctively, would say the child. But </span><a
href="http://www.williammacaskill.com/" target="_blank"><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>Will MacAskill</span></a><span style='font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>, Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University
of Oxford, would say to save the million dollar painting. His argument is that
by saving the painting, cashing it in, and providing malaria bed nets to
impoverished African nations you would be able to save hundreds of thousands of
children.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>This
answer feels wrong, but that is MacAskill’s point. He argues that we as humans
are ill-adapted to modernity and our conventional notion of ethics is not
suitable for today. MacAskill has taken our burning house dilemma and has
re-framed it in a well known philosophic problem known as the Trolley problem.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
Trolley problem states that you are driving a trolley and your current path
will kill five workers, but there is a switch that will redirect your trolley
on a path with only one worker. You can either save one worker or save five.
With the burning house scenario you can either save one child or save thousands
of children.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>While it
is easy to immediately jump into an ethical debate about utilitarianism (and it
usually does), I want to slow down and observe something interesting.
Generally, when the Trolley problem is brought up in an ethics class, someone
gets up and talks about how unrealistic the scenario is. (Spoiler alert: it was
me in my ethics class). But the burning house problem is specifically designed
to sound somewhat plausible. <i>Why?</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>For me,
the defining difference is when the idea of exchanging the painting for money
comes into play. Adding the exchange value of money allows so many
possibilities to open up. MacAskill, while a smart guy, seems to be missing a
huge dimension of ethical thought — the moral dimensions of economics.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
failure to discuss the moral implications of the economy is a valid criticism
of Effective Altruism, the movement inspired by MacAskill’s ideas to maximize
social return. Generally these criticisms are brought on by members of the far
left, such as the Occupy movement. These critiques say that contributing to
charity is good but the “effectiveness” of your charity will always be
sub-optimal. If you do not address the systemic problems that cause the need
for charity, you never get rid of the need for charity. The most vocal
criticism came from one of Occupy’s most central organizers in <i>Debt: the
first 5000 years</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In <i>Debt
</i>David Graeber, now Professor of Anthropology at the London School of
Economics, covers the history and evolution of debt. Graeber spends much of the
book discussing a variety of interesting phenomenon across history and
sociology including the simultaneous rise of organized religion and increased
debt, the military-coinage-slavery complex, and “everyday communism.” It is a
fascinating read, although there is much to disagree with.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Graeber
begins <i>Debt</i> with an anecdote about how the idea of the book came around.
Graeber was at a party and was introduced to a “do-gooder” human rights lawyer
as one of the Occupy organizers. The conversation turned to other forms of his
activism. He mentioned his struggles with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF). He talks about how the IMF facilitated the creation of the third world
debt crisis, which led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. At one
point he mentions how IMF austerity measures cut malaria eradication programs
and tens of thousands of children died. At some point, the lawyer asks Graeber,
“But surely the blame is on the one who borrowed? After all, one has to pay
their debts.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I’m hoping
the parallels are self-evident. Children dying of malaria, a choice, and money
as the mediator. While Graeber gets closer to the heart of the matter than
MacAskill, his radical politics keep pulling him into other dialogues. The
heart of the issue is that <i>money acts as an ethical obscurant</i>. It can
hide or misdirect the morality of almost any given situation. Money may be the
world’s first and only moral technology.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In <i>the
Republic</i>, Socrates went from person to person asking “What is the Good?”
This was originally asked to question the notion of the Platonic ideal, but it
is notable because it asked the central moral question of that era. Actually,
one of my main personal criticisms of the Effective Altruism movement is that
they are prematurely optimizing. I also think they haven’t centered around what
we should consider as a social good. But more importantly, even beyond defining
what is good and evil, we have a much more pressing moral question at hand in
the modern era. Can we separate moral action from moral ontology? Or, put
another way, are we only what we do and what if what we do is inauthentic to
who we are as people?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>This seems
abstract and philosophical. Ontology? Moral action? If you are a 9-to-5-er, NPC
normie this seems far removed from day to day life. The highest call to moral
action seems to be who should pick the kids up from daycare. Consider this:</span></p>

Not Being Yourself</span></b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'><br>
<i>Capitalism is only part of the problem</i>medium.com</span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>This
Medium essay supposes that the central reason we hate going back to work on
Mondays is because we cannot be authentic. It makes sense that if money can
obscure moral action, an organization based on making as much money as possible
would similarly be obscured to the extent of obscuring you from yourself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I want to
add a corollary to that. I would say that most compartmentalize their work
actions and home life actions into separate buckets. Most only give moral
consideration to their home life actions. If you work at an oil rig or for a
defense company, you don’t consider yourself immoral even though your actions
direct will harm the environment or others. The oil rig worker would rather be
judged according to how he treats his wife and kids, and would feel as though
he fairs better because of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But you
don’t get to choose. Even if they feel like different people, work you and home
you are the same person. You are responsible for the actions of any persona you
adopt. This was somewhat decided in the Nuremburg trials, but has taken a long
time for the world to adopt. If you think about it, the defense contractor
engineer’s defense is no different from “I was just following orders.” But we
seem to have a hard time recognizing it as such.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Pop
culture has picked this up too. <i>Breaking Bad, Bojack Horseman, the Sopranos,
the Wire</i>, and a host of other media recognize the dichotomy of believing
oneself as upright and the reality of their actions, often using money as an obscuring
agent. That’s why many of those characters claim an ‘anti-hero’ status, when if
we judge them solely on actions they tend more towards villain than hero. In
fact, the whole work-you vs home-you dichotomy was done really well in the most
recent season of Bojack Horseman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I don’t
want to seem as though money is inherently bankrupt (*rimshot*). In the burning
house scenario, introducing the idea of exchanging the painting for money makes
us more aware of our capacities. The largest issue is that what we can do is
sometimes obscured by the trappings of the human mind. Urgency short circuits
what is the rational result — save as many as possible as often as possible.
MacAskill’s point may be that we are embedded in a system that will allow us to
do tremendous good if we can recognize these opportunities. We will also need
to condition ourselves to take advantage of them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>My whole
point is that we need to start recognizing money as a ‘moral technology.’ It
seems weird to call a piece of paper a technology, doesn’t it? </span><a
href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/technology" target="_blank"><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Merriam-Webster defines technology
as</span></a><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>2. a
manner of accomplishing a task especially using </span><a
href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/technical#h1" target="_blank"><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>technical</span></a><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> processes, methods, or knowledge</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Money very
clearly meets this definition. It enables people to do certain tasks by being
an incentive when there is none available. Money also requires deep technical
knowledge to produce or move. Think of the Federal Reserve. But money never
specifies what task to do or whether that task is “good” or “bad.” That’s why
money is so dangerous and somewhat misunderstood. It compels towards action but
never specifies the nature of the action and thus obscures our conventional
sense of morality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Kurt
Vonnegut’s <i>Mother Night</i> does this well. In the novel, Howard Campbell Jr
is asked to join the Nazi propaganda machine as a double agent. There is no
hope that his true allegiance could ever be revealed. Campbell is fed coded
information which he works into the propaganda. This information is of
tremendous benefit to the Allies, even though he never finds out what it did
himself. The novel follows him dealing with his choices post-WWII in some form
of witness protection. The vast majority of the public believes Campbell to be
a prominent Nazi propagandist in spite of his role as a double agent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Much like
Campbell, most of us are divorced from the impacts of our decisions. Our
day-to-day purchases may be causing environmental ruin in the Amazons or
funding child-labor in some faraway sweatshop. But we can never tell. It may
equally be allowing someone’s daughter to go to ballet lessons. Whether we are
working as coal miners or hospital administrators, we most likely will never
face the consequences or rewards of our actions. That’s the issues with systems
in general — responsibility is diffused so that no one carries all the blame,
but everyone shoulders some of it. Our financial and social systems are so
complex we can’t discern what, if anything, we are doing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>At this
point, it would be great to hear advice on how to tackle this moral obscurity
we all face. If you have any, please let me know. I often feel this strange
cloud of depression from our sublime detachment from accountability. I cannot
offer you any way forward. It is paralyzing, when you think of moral confusion
in earnest but impractical to spend you life fixating on it. In the spirit of
practicality then, I leave you with this:</span></p>

you do will be insignificant, but it is very important that you do it.”</span></p>
