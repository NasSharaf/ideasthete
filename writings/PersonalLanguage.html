<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>What if
everyone made their own language?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I was
talking to a friend and we were talking about nostalgia and progress when I
brought up how language affects our notions of time. My friend was puzzled, so
I sent him the following TED talk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The talk
discusses how languages can affect retirement savings. Swedish and Chinese
speakers save more for their retirement, supposedly because of how their
language handles tenses (past tense, future tense, etc). Surprisingly, my
friend was pretty resistant to accepting the main thesis of Mr.Chen’s talk,
which was that language affect perception. This is actually a well-known theory
in linguistics, called the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In
addition to finances, this language relativity can be found in a few
interesting places. There is a tribe that only has the words “one”, “two”, and
“many.” They have a hard time counting higher numbers. Speaking of numbers, its
often proposed that Chinese and Japanese students are, as per stereotype,
actually better at math because the language makes it easier to do math
mentally. There are several debates about how language affects color
perception. This was discussed in the much acclaimed RadioLab episode “Colors.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/211119-colors/"

"Times New Roman",serif'>Colors</span></b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'><br>
<i>Radiolab rips the rainbow a new one.</i>www.radiolab.org</span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But my
friend is right to doubt this hypothesis. Most of the examples I’ve offered are
heavily disputed. Still, this is a beautiful idea not because it might explain
every day phenomenon but because it might provide us tools to manufacture our
own experiences. Most specifically, by constructing or creating our own
languages.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>When I was
a kid, I used to create alphabets and write codes to pass notes to my friends.
I remember that at one point, around 5th grade maybe, we all decided to use the
<i>Bionicle</i> language. One student was caught writing some unsavory things
about a teacher and we were not allowed to write in code again. Ah well. But
this form of constructed language is probably most familiar to all of us. The
artistic or literary constructed language.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Think of
Elvish in <i>Lord of The Rings</i> or Klingon from <i>Star Trek</i>. These were
languages constructed to develop a rich fantastical world, with their own
grammar and vocabulary. These went a step beyond just an alphabet cypher,
because there was actual semantics involved. There was actual vocabulary and
grammar in these cases, not just a letter-for-symbol swap. Nerdy, but
ultimately harmless. And useless in the grand scheme of things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>A more
useful constructed language might be Esperanto. Esperanto is what is called an
“international auxiliary language.” It is a language that is meant to help
facilitate learning other languages. It by itself isn’t meant to be a universal
language, but can help unite different language speakers in the same way a
universal language might.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Esperanto
is the largest spoken constructed language and has sometimes been empirically
been able to show that it can help learn other languages faster. It is also
largely the work of one L. L. Zamenhof, a Polish medical doctor. I bring this
up to show that, 1) a single person can construct a language and 2) that person
does not have to be a linguist (although I’m sure he must be reasonably
intelligent).</span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Why Learn Esperanto? (Special
Feature) - Freakonomics</span></b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'><br>
<i>A language invented in the 19th century, and meant to be universal, it never
really caught on. So why does a group of…</i>freakonomics.com</span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But where
exactly does the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis fit into all of this? Esperanto has not
shown to profoundly affect perception. Neither has Klingon or Quenya. So what
constructed languages use, or try to use, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and what
could this possibly mean for us?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>One
literary example might be Orwell’s Newspeak. Recall, in <i>1984</i>, the
construction of a language that was devised to reduce complexity. “Excellent”
and “Great” no longer existed and were now “doubleplus good” or “good.” The
main point the book was trying to make was that restricting language was to
restrict thought itself. That authoritarianism is enforced by not allowing for
the idea of freedom at all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I think
all of this is fascinating, but not captivating. It still does not feel like
this line of thought has any relevance to us, right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Underlying
all of this is one assumption — that language is used to communicate to others,
external to our selves. I think all of these thoughts take on a whole new
dimension when you consider that you are constantly communicating to yourself.
So now the question is, how does the language you think in affect your
perceptions about yourself?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Perhaps
most dangerously, would it be possible to construct a language specifically for
yourself, to affect your perception about yourself?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I don’t
think this is as absurd as it may initially come off. Millions of people give
themselves positive self-talk. And the idea of languages affecting your own
personality is well established. In fact, its often noted that language
super-learners (“polyglots”) share characteristics with actors and comedians,
being able to slide effortlessly between characters and voices and accents.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I also
think there would be a strong connection to meditation and mantras. Repeating
mantras in meditation is often recommended to help focus and de-clutter the
mind. There are many types of meditation, but the type of meditation I’ve been
exposed to speak of noticing when the mind drifts and not trying to control
that, but let that thought go and circle back to the mantra. It’s like how
saying the word “pigeon” over and over makes it sound weird. At first you will
notice how weird it sounds, then your mind will drift, but eventually you will
come back to the repetitiveness of the word.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But
whereas meditation gently guides one to non-thought, developing a personal
language would explore and express entirely new thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Let’s say
you are meditating and you notice that the feeling of “I am in great pain”
comes up quite often. Let’s say instead you decide to call this
“Wabba-labba-dub-dubs.” Imagine now that you notice a whole host of internal
states like this and relationships between those states, enough that you could
construct a whole vocabulary around it. Would this not be a personal language?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>You might
think this is an extreme undertaking, but look to the Dictionary of Obscure
Sorrows — a one man project to identify and name various internal states.
Several of the words John Keonig (the creator of the project) have been used
publicly, like sonder and onism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Pardon the
Tumblr-yness of it. Still interesting in spite of itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And it
doesn’t have to be entirely new vocabulary. E-prime, for example, is a
constructed (destructed?) language that simply removes “to be” and other
existential variants from garden-variety English. The idea behind E-prime is to
make English less dogmatic. I personally have also wondered what speaking
English without every using “I” or “myself” would do to a person. One way to
construct a personal language might be to take away words when talking to
oneself, rather than build up new words. Maybe both.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now, to be
fair, this isn’t an entirely original idea. Philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein
thought of the idea of a “private language” similar to what I’ve described, but
rallied against it claiming that a private language would be incoherent.
Wittgenstein specifically called on the “Beetle in a Box” metaphor,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Imagine
that there is an obscure tribe that has few if any insects on their land. You
hand each member of the tribe a box and tell them that there is a “beetle”
inside of it. No one can look inside of anyone’s box but their own, and only
knows what a “beetle” is by looking at the one they’ve been given. Wittgenstein
posited that this “beetle,” like pain or colors, was only useful linguistically
by its discussion. I don’t know for sure if the pain I feel is the same thing
you feel, but we both can refer to the same unpleasant sensation with the word
“pain.” Similarly, we don’t know what’s in each others box, but we know what we
refer to when we say “beetle.”</span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Episode 97 - Transcript</span></b><span

<i>This is a transcript of episode #097 on Ludwig Wittgenstein. Check out the
episode page HERE. So I want to start today…</i>philosophizethis.org</span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The idea
that language is socially constructed and socially used would seem to put a
damper on the idea of private language. Wittgenstein had other rules as to what
constitutes a private language, like that one cannot simply be the last speaker
of an established language. A private language must be untranslatable. What I
am proposing though, does not have to be untranslatable. It just must be
personal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It is
possible, that if adopted on amass scale, this personal language could
drastically change human understanding. After all, anthropologists are quick to
recognize the beginning of civilization coincided with the written word. It is
evident that the first revolution, before the agricultural revolution and the
industrial revolution and so on, must have been the language revolution. But
where there have been multiple industrial revolutions there has only been one
language revolution (unless the written word counts separately I suppose).
While it would be logical to believe that a Second Language Revolution would be
a universal language (a return to the Tower of Babel?), maybe the Second
Language Revolution is actually the universal adoption of personal languages.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But that’s
a bit grandiose, no?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The use of
the personal language is, as already mentioned, to gain a deeper understanding
of the self. One framework for how we might perceive ourselves is the Johari
Window.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I think
its pretty self-explanatory, but to walk through it quick there are things that
we know about ourselves that is known to other, things known about ourselves
not known to others, things others know about us not known to our selves, and a
mysterious part of us not known to ourselves or others.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It is
possible to change these areas. They are not static. One could, of course, ask
for feedback. Which might be somewhat painful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'><img
border=0 width=468 height=529 id="Picture 1"
src="Personal%20Language.fld/image002.jpg"

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I was
first exposed to this Johari window through my father who told me at the time
that another, more common and more tragic way of changing the areas within the
window is enduring a trauma. Obviously enduring a great pain gives one a
greater knowledge of self, in some form or another. Too often it is regretfully
realizing something was lost. But I think the personal language idea allows one
to gain a greater understanding of the self in a traumaless way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In the
Johari window, when someone suffers a trauma the cross hair moves up and to the
right. Basically, the Arena (whats known to others and you) and the Facade
(known to you but not others) grow bigger. A personal language, I believe,
would achieve a similar effect but without the pain. It might even help
mitigate depression or trauma. I don’t have proof of this, but I do believe
that creating things is the best way out of a funk and there is nothing as low
cost as making up a word. So drafting or engineering a language doesn’t require
resources but engages that creative part of the brain while gaining a stronger
sense of identity, which might help combat some errant thoughts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Which I
think would be a beautiful thing.</span></p>
