<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Its easy
to write about things you see wrong or to criticize modernity. Most of my
writing generally is motivated by flaws I see, real or imagined, but very
little is actually written about what should be or some way to improve the
things I find fault with. From a writing point of view, it’s a real steep slope
from idealism to manifesto, which is why I avoid writing about what path I
think should be pursued. But I do believe I have, if not a map to prosperity, a
compass in the general direction we as a civilization need to go. It starts
with something called biomimicry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Biomimicry
is simply mimicking systems or structures found in nature to solve a problem.
It is a specific design pattern in engineering, old but not widely considered.
The usual example is velcro. An electrical engineer named George de Mestral
once went on walk through some nearby forest with his dog and came home to find
burrs stuck to his dog’s fur. De Mestral realized that one could create a
mechanical adhesive by mimicking the hooks of the burr and the loops of the
fur, which is how velcro came about.</span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Notice,
biomimicry doesn’t mean directly mimicking the structure or system you find in
nature, but <i>to use the principles and mechanisms proven in nature to develop
a new technology</i>. Trying to directly mimic natural phenomenon can sometimes
be more of a detriment than an advantage. There were thousands of failed
aircraft attempting to mimic birds, most famously a design by Leonardo da
Vinci, but in the end the Wright Brothers’ design had stationary wings and
relied more on propellers for propulsion than dynamic wings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Conversely,
excellent examples of biomimicry tend to not outwardly look like direct
analogues of their inspiration. Artificial photosynthesis, though in principle
working like a leaf, looks nothing like a plant form. Sonar looks nothing like
a dolphin or a bat. But both of these operate off of a principle or mechanism
observed in nature.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>An
overused example is definitely the golden spiral. There is something called the
Fibonacci sequence which is generated by taking two previous terms to generate
the next terms. The first few are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13…and so on. If you
take the ratio of two of these terms, they tend towards an irrational number
estimated at 1.618… that is called the golden ratio. This ratio and the
Fibonacci numbers have an odd tendency to appear in all sorts of places in
nature, from sunflower seeds to pine cones.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The golden
ratio is a very pretty and marketable math fact about nature and tends to go
the rounds a lot in pop culture, much to many mathematicians chagrin. Some of
this is scientists just being stiffs and hating anything fun, but a lot of it
is because most pop culture explanations miss exactly why the golden ratio is
so prevalent in nature. It’s because it’s very useful in packing things
together or trying to optimize something in a finite space. When you understand
this, applying the golden ratio is no longer about pretty spirals or perfectly
proportioned rectangles in architecture. Golden search optimization and golden
ratio solar panel arrangements don’t just look pretty but are actually useful
for solving a problem.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So far
we’ve seen some examples of applying biomimicry to create a product or a
specific engineering solution. But let’s go one step further. Could you create
an entire biomimetic system? Are there working principles in nature we could
use to design political or economic systems?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Is it
possible to create a philosophy on the working principles of nature?</span></p>

<hr size=0 width="100%" align=center>

</span></div>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Stated as
an English sentence, of course, this is just a banal platitude-but the fact is
that, in the day-to-day trenches of adult existence, banal platitudes can have
life-or-death importance. That may sound like hyperbole, or abstract nonsense.
So let’s get concrete…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>— David
Foster Wallace</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>At this
point, it’s going to get uncomfortable for me because I am about to show the
true shallowness of my thought. But I should begin by saying that I am a
religious person and I do believe in a higher power. It’s absolutely fine if
you do not, I bear you no ill will nor do I pass any judgement, but I hope you
can read on with that same courtesy extended to me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Imitation
is supposedly the most sincere form of flattery, and if I’ve successfully
impressed upon you that biomimicry is a step beyond imitation, then what is
biomimicry the most sincere form of? I would say (again, just bear with me)
biomimicry is the most sincere form of love or worship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I don’t
mean romantic love. I think that’s mostly bullshit. Most of what we
colloquially think of as love is just some bullshit myth we feed ourselves to
believe our lives have any significance (it doesn’t have any significance). But
to deny the existence of a close bond flies in the face of observable reality.
Of course people care for reach other, it’s just it probably won’t be some
stranger you meet for the first time. A quick test, for me, is to see how
sustainable any of those relationships are and the degree they are corruptible.
Most relationships fail unless there is constant effort put in, and often they
can be easily manipulated or corrupted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
deepest form of love that I think actually qualifies is between parent and
child. While such relationships are far from perfect and can be corrupted by
drugs or media, they are quite resilient in the face of life’s everyday
troubles. But the other reason I accept a parent-child relationship as a
meaningful example of love is because it reveals a truth about love. Namely,
that love is deeply entwined with creation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Parents
create the child with a belief or commitment to love their creation. It’s the
same with art, or music, or engineering. Ask an artist why they made a painting
or a musician why they wrote a song. They will likely say “Because I wanted
to,” but why did they want to? Often, the artist or musician or engineer may
not be able to articulate it, but it was because they fell in love with the
idea before they actually set out to create it.</span></p>

examples of biomimicry</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The joke
is that true creation is impossible. An artist paints with colors they did not
create. A musician uses instruments they did not craft, notes they did not
bring into being. Even parents only pass along genes in a succession of genes,
not of their unique creation. Most of what we call “creating” is actually just
“arranging.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>This is
where the religion kicks in. Imagine if there was a first creator, some being
that had the power and capacity to not just paint with colors, but create
colors themselves and even beyond that the idea of colors. The notion of wave
that can interpreted visually. Some being that could create the idea of a
“wave.” Absolutely basic, take-for-granted aspects of reality we never think
twice about. Why would this being take the trouble to create anything?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Why does a
musician write a song?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>If true
creation is outside of our power, our only option is imitation. In this way,
biomimicry is a form of worship, to be cognizant of nature, our place in it and
think deeply about how it works but to also create in its image. I hope you can
see that you do not have to believe in my God specifically, but that it helps
to believe in some higher power to reach this conclusion.</span></p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>

<hr size=0 width="100%" align=center>

</span></div>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It seems
pointless to point out such soft and airy-fairy underpinnings for an already
useful and pragmatic philosophy. Why muddy the waters for an already hippie-ish
ideology with thoughts about art and love? Couldn’t we just stick to the hard
engineering of biomimicry and reap those benefits?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The issue
to me is that to pursue biomimicry, if I have indeed convinced you that it is
worth pursuing, in this current context would do no good. Biomimicry seeks to
address reality, which I would believe is that everything we do is part of
nature and that we should live in accordance with the laws that govern nature.
But our current context stands opposed to that, by which I mean mass
civilization.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>When I say
civilization, I mean in some academic sense. There are many definitions as to
what exactly counts as civilization, but common characteristics include:</span></p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>written
     language</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>monumental
     architecture</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>agriculture</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>technological
     advancement</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>social
     stratification/job specialization</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>government</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>cities
     and urban centers</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>art and
     culture</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Many of
these things are relatively innocuous. A written language, art, and culture are
not by themselves unique to civilizations and are often found in “tribal” or
“primitive” cultures. But the things that are different and unique to
civilizations — agriculture, technological advancement, government — are often
in opposition or an attempt to dominate over nature rather than work with
nature. Agriculture and cities and technology often attempt to outpace or
extract or control the environment. They are designed for the explicit benefit
of humanity and humanity only.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>This is
not to say that technology or agriculture are bad things, nor am I trying to
promote the appeal to nature fallacy. As an engineer, I am a very strong
proponent for technology and spend my day-to-day trying to make some
advancement. But to design without some consideration for sustainability is
absurd. And we should recognize that our systems and institutions were just as
much designed as a car. Mostly likely our political and economic and
philosophic systems took no consideration of what exists in nature or perhaps
more arrogantly don’t believe nature has anything to offer on this front.</span></p>

example of bioregionalist divisions [</span><a

style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But what
would biomimicry look like, politically or economically? An example would be
bioregionalism, a movement that believes political boundaries should be redrawn
to match the ecosystems closest to it and that cultural regions coagulate
around ecosystem. As an example, maybe Pennsylvania would be split into three
regions, one closest to the Great Lakes, one encompassing Appalachia, and a
coastal portion. This is particularly striking to me because, if you know any
Pennsylvanians, they may tell you about how different each of these regions
are. The Appalachian region for example, is sometimes called “Pennsyl-tucky”
due to its cultural difference with the coastal ends, which goes to show that
even now there is some acknowledgement of these bioregions. Bioregionalism
would also mean major reforms to our electoral college, to gerrymandered and
red-lined districts, and to labor markets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Another,
maybe more extensive vision for biomimicry can be found in the work of Wes
Jackson of the Land Institute. Jackson, as a child, was touring a prairie farm
and wondered to himself why farmers can’t grow annual grains like wheat grass
and instead grow perennial grains that deplete the soil. Spending years cross
breeding many grains, Jackson has developed Kernza, a perennial grain that can
be harvested year after year without depleting the soil. Kernza grows to look
like a field of wild prairie grass. The Kernza seeds have seen some early
success with Patagonia provisions and some brewers have even made a Kernza ale.
This is a striking example because wheat is already a natural element, but is
used in a manner that opposes nature. Kernza, on the other hand, achieves human
goals but operates sustainably within the laws of nature.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>If you
look around you will probably see many places where human advancement was indebted
to bio-inspiration. All I am saying is to look deeper.</span></p>
