<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>You walk
into the dimly lit basement, low hanging lights shining artificial and bleached
white. The smell of cheap, burnt coffee and dry pastries on a white fold out
table. Matches with the fold out chairs arranged in a circle in the middle of
the room. Worn out sneakers cross the stain covered carpet to the nearest
unoccupied chair, and you can feel the cold of the just out of the storage
metal frame through your jeans. Low murmurs on the outskirts of the circle,
members holding steaming Styrofoam cups of coffee more for warmth than taste.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>A middle-aged
man, shaped like a pear and going bald, gold-rimmed bifocal glasses glinting in
the stark, pale light calls to order.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Will
everyone please take a seat? I’d like to get started,” he intoned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Shadows
fill the seats. The pear-shaped man begins with a prayer, to which the shadows
echo:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“<i>God,
grant me the serenity<br>
To accept that people cannot change;<br>
Courage to know that I am what I am;<br>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>A brief

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Welcome
everyone. My name is Harold, I’ll be the chair for tonight. Are there any
newcomers?” His eyes flicker over you, an acknowledgement but not pressure.
Nothing noticeable to the others, thank God. But on the outskirts of the

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Hello
everyone, my name is Jared and I’m an addict.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Uh, so
like most people my age I was afraid of the real world and I decided to get a
PhD. Cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, specifically. And it was good
for a while, life was pretty good. I had a girlfriend, of course. That was
before I swore the whole thing off. We had a place together, she worked and I
did the graduate thing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I don’t
want to get too into the weeds, but it is kind of important what work I was
doing. My research was specifically trying to figure out how to hack neural
networks. Hmm…I see some blanks faces. Alright, so basically, a few decades ago
some computer scientists modeled human neurons on a computer. These models are
basically computers in and of themselves. The whole thing went through a few
ups and downs in terms of popularity. We just didn’t have the power to really
mess with these things at scale that mattered until pretty recently. A few
really great papers came out and it was another heyday for neural nets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So, I come
in, eager beaver grad student bent on winning a Turing Prize and my PI sets me
to work on how to hack a neural net. People were so focused on building more
and more accurate networks that they forgot how easily they could be fooled!
Have you ever seen that picture that looks like a duck one way but a rabbit
another? If the human mind can be fooled so easily, what does that say about
these models that don’t even come close to the processing power of even a
mouse?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Of course,
my girlfriend leaves me. It was probably a factor of things. I was working long
hours. I’m not an easy person to live with, I know that. But I also think I
loved her more than she loved me. Like I was just a placeholder for her, you
know? Someone for her to waste time with until she moved one to what she
wanted. That’s what stung the most at the time, the underlying indifference. It
didn’t help that she was smarter than me at every turn. Maybe part of the
reason I was so hellbent getting some recognition was to prove I was on her
level. No one ever made me feel so small and so important at the same time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Of course,
I do the usual break up stuff. Mope around, cried a lot, listened to shitty emo
pop-punk, wrote shitty emo poetry. The works. Everyone told me that I found
find another girl, that it would be alright, yada yada yada. My PI, the
postdocs…my mom. It sucked. But then I realized.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>My
girlfriend basically hacked me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>See, in a
neural network, the neurons basically solve a problem by attributing a weight
to a variety of possible solutions. This “weight” is like emotions in a human
brain. The neural networks feel their way through a problem. In my research, we
were trying to hack the neural network by feeding data that would automatically
change the weights inside — like LSD or cocaine does chemically to our brain.
Try to get the neural network to keep seeking this data out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But I set
up a generative adversarial network or a GAN. Yeah, I know, this is getting in
the weeds. It’s basically two neural networks that fight each other. Real
wizard shit. But what I tried to do was get one neural network to make the
other fall in love with it. This would make the second change its own weights
internally. You could almost say I was trying to teach a computer to love. But
it was simpler than that. I was reducing love to a mathematical equation. It
could be quantified. Just like anything else.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>This has
all been very inspiring and the initial experiments have been promising. But
you know what? I don’t even care if I get recognized anymore. I realized
something awful. We are all susceptible to love. Which means we are all
security risks. And I can’t have that. That’s why I promise to no longer ever
love.</span></p>

big man, built like a tree trunk. He’s older, and carries himself like a storm
beaten reed. His clean-shaven boyish face and big ears don’t seem to match his
heavyset demeanor.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Hi, my
name is Tom and I’m an addict.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I grew up
in Elyria, Ohio. It was a small town and you knew early on who was going to
move on to bigger and better things and who was going to stay. I stayed. For a
little bit at least. I had a kid junior year of high school, so I tried to do
right and make it work as long as I could. We married, I mean, what else was I
gonna do? But eventually money was too tight to bear. So, I decided to turn in
my two weeks at the local Dairy Queen and went to talk to a recruiter. I did
the standard four-year stint and saw some action. But when it was over, it was
over. I came back and got a job pretty quickly actually. If you play your cards
right, employers love a veteran. By now me and the missus moved out of Elyria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Things
were looking up, on paper at least but I just felt…I don’t know. Like
everything was in a fog. Not in a depressed type way, but more like nothing
mattered. I knew that if my wife was yelling at me I should feel something, but
I didn’t. Everything was boring. I was doing okay at my insurance sales jobs,
but I wasn’t a high achiever by a long shot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So, I
start looking around and I start applying to PMC type jobs. Private military
contractors, for those that can’t keep up. I get a call back from one. And he
seemed legit at the time. I mean he called himself as an equivalent to a First
Lieutenant even though he seemed to be in charge as far as I could tell.
Saunders was his name. Now, I’ve done my research and I knew what I wanted. I
wasn’t going to be someone’s delivery boy, I wanted action. No rent-a-cop
bullshit. And Saunders to his credit followed through. He showed me the
contracts, they were real. I found out later they were real firsthand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>He said
he’d hire me on the condition that I pass his training. Sure, no big deal. I’d
done basic and I’ve been good at keeping the post-service weight off. I
figured, a few pushups, some two-a-days, and I’d be ready to rock and roll. Boy
was I wrong.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>There's
been a lot of military training doctrines throughout the years. Almost every
four-star-wannabe swears theirs works but every POG knows they’re mostly the
same. A pushup is a pushup. Eating shit is just eating shit and changing the
context doesn’t change the fact that you’re still eating shit. But Saunders
figured it out. He knew that the only things that motivate a person are fear
and love. I learned it in sales, I don’t know where he picked it up. And where
love and fear meet, we call it addiction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Saunders
had us ask the “36 Questions to fall in love” while we were under some truly
sadistic situations of his construction. They’re 36 questions which, when asked
to a stranger, will make you fall in love or at least grow close to. The idea
was stress and the opportunity for human connection would form our unit. It’s
one thing to answer “What, if anything, is too serious to be joked about?” in a
bar across some attractive woman. It’s another thing entirely when you and your
unit have been gassed with nitrous oxide for twenty minutes and you’re sure
you’re going to die of laughter. Maybe it sounds funny to you. It wasn’t funny
to the mothers of the recruits that didn’t make it. You really have to pay
attention when your partner’s answer to “What would you regret not having told
someone?” is the only thing that can disarm a live bomb. It was illegal, and
looking back, it’s absolutely clear that it was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But none
of us could turn away. Because it was working. We were growing closer together
as a unit, they truly felt like my brothers. And Saunders could do no wrong. He
was our charismatic God-emperor. I think Saunders was influenced by the
Hashshashins. You know, that Persian order of assassins? They say that the
leader of the original order of assassins gave his followers the wildest time,
women and drugs and partying, and convinced them that was what heaven was like.
He convinced them that if they followed him that’s what they could have for
eternity. Same kind of thing happened to us. Most veterans miss the
camaraderie, that’s well known, but Saunders managed to not only recruit on
that, but ramp it up to eleven.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>When the
training was done though, that’s when the fun began. Like I said, there’s no
adrenaline rush like battle. And after the training, me and my brothers running
unbridled and free, working to our fullest capacities, it felt like nothing
could stop us. It was raw power, and it was amazing. I never felt the love I
felt for my unit with my wife or my kids. And I realize now, that was for the
best. I think back to some of the things I’ve done, in the name of my unit and
I… Some were only children man. Little boys and girls…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It came to
a head when Saunders found out one of our members was gay. He was a hardliner
against that sort of thing. I don’t know what happened to him. It’s easy to
assume the worst, but I also do truly doubt Saunders would do that to anyone in
our organization. But whatever happened, that was the beginning of the end. It
kind of just fizzled out. I was one of the last to leave. All I had was time
and endless replays of those few years. And I realized what horror I had done.
I realized what did, all because of I felt love. So, I swore it off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>He has
a shaved head, and a tattoo of some Chinese or Japanese characters on his on
his collarbone running down his pectoral. He is wearing a bright orange V-neck
and you can’t tell whether he looks like a criminal or a monk.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>My name is
Raymond, you can call me Ray, and I guess I’m an addict.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So…I guess
it was a lot like most of you guys. It started when I was a teenager and just
got worse from there. It would strike harder and deeper each time. I always
looked young for my age. And I broke out well into my twenties. Not that anyone
could tell I was twenty-something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Anyways,
it finally happened that it came on too strong. I fell hard for this musician I
met a party. She said no, as per usual. We had a few run-ins before that
happened though, moments where I think we could’ve been friends at the least.
But she said no. I went by her house a few times, tried to get in with her
friends, refreshed her Facebook page religiously up until she finally blocked
me. I’d done all of that before, that’s not pushed me away from the idea of
love itself. For whatever reason I just couldn’t get her out of my head.
Everywhere I looked, there she was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I asked
her out one last time. The police arrived with half an hour. They tried to
resuscitate her, but she was gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Jail was
good for me though, believe it or not. I got three square meals a day for the
first time since my mother left us. I worked out almost daily and finally
stopped looking like the Addams family’s forgotten child. I grew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Except I
kept seeing her. I even at one point went to the prison doctor about it. He
told me I had a limerence. That I was obsessive. He told me I’d have to live
with it, there wasn’t anything he could do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>But I
couldn’t. Something snapped again, and when it was done I was confined to
solitary. I thought it would get better, that I’d stop seeing her, but it just
got worse. I’ve talked to other former prisoners now that I’m out and everyone
who survived solitary all say they managed by basically living inside their
heads. There was a famous case of a musician who basically created his greatest
concerto while he was a political prisoner in isolation. Which is great, if you
weren’t already in love with the idea of someone who died so long ago.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Sixteen
years. Sixteen years in isolation. I still had ten more to go when I was
finally allowed to be with the other prisoners. The first thing I did was see
the doctor. Everyone I passed looked like her. Even the doctor looked like her.
It was like I couldn’t process any other face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I’m not
even sure it was the same doctor, because this time he was effective. He told
me to read. I read everything. I read the dictionary, front to back, twice.
Anything to distract from the inner world I made from a few conversations with
someone from twenty odd years ago. He also told me to take painkillers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The idea
was that the painkillers would stop me from empathizing with anyone. If you
can’t feel pain, how are you going to feel someone else’s pain, right? And if
you can’t empathize, how will you ever fall in love?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>It worked.
Early release. I saw this doctor pretty regularly, worked with him. I think. He
told me, similar to how many NA or AA sorts of places do, to learn to love
myself. And I did, for a little bit. But then, instead of seeing her in
everyone, I saw myself. My face on every other face. Like a carnival mirror,
not as exaggerated. Everything’s a little bit off, but it’s me, you know?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>So
anyways, model prisoner, except for one spat nearly twenty years ago. Which
means early release. Parole. But now I was out in this big world all by myself.
I had no idea what to do. I still kept seeing just me. I slowly escalated the
painkillers. First it was aspirin, but somehow it ended with heroin. I kicked
that quick though when I realized what I really need to do — kick the addiction
of love. Then I will see things as they really are.</span></p>

serious and all business.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Hey. Did
you get what you need?”</span></p>

okay. Good. I am excited to read what you come up with. It’s been a while…”</span></p>

himself. You press him. A while since what?</span></p>

not important. Alright, just don’t take this the wrong way, I don’t mean
